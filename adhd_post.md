Artificial intelligence and machine learning models are significant in diagnosing and classifying ADHD, achieving high accuracy rates. These models utilize key indicators of ADHD, task performance, and neuro-behavioral data. Some models even use features extracted from EEG data. The MIMIC-IV database, which contains de-identified health information, can be used in conjunction with these models for ADHD severity classification. The severity level is determined by analyzing a variety of factors, including personal, medical, and psychological information. Therefore, the severity of ADHD patients can be determined using these machine learning models on the MIMIC-IV database.
